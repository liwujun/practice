 * Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

 * Note:
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ¡Ü k ¡Ü BST's total elements.
 * <p/>
 * Follow up:
 * What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations)
 * often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
