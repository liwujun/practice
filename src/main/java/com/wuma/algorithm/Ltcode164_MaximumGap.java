 * Given an unsorted array, find the maximum
 * difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.
 * Try to solve it in linear time/space.
 * Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.
 * You may assume all elements in the array
 * are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
