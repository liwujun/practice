 * Design and implement a data structure for
 * Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support
 * the following operations: get and set.
 * get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of
 * the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
 * set(key, value) - Set or insert the value if
 * the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity,
 * it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
